Session:
File-based Persistence:
    Pros:
        Fast for small-scale applications.
        Doesn't require external systems or database connections.
    Cons:
        May not scale well with a large number of concurrent sessions.
        Could be problematic in distributed server environments.
        Risk of data loss if the server filesystem gets corrupted.

Database Persistence:
    Pros:
        Scales well for applications with many users.
        Easier to manage in distributed environments.
        Built-in backup and recovery mechanisms.
    Cons:
        Requires a database connection, which might introduce latency.
        More complex setup than file-based persistence.
